# zambony
GUI frontend to cdrecord/wodim that was largely inspired by Judd Vinet's PyBurn script. 
The main difference between zambony and PyBurn is that zambony uses Tk rather than GTK 
for its GUI.

The purpose of zambony is to have a simple, dependency free, frontend to cdrecord/wodim.

Currently only supports burning data CD-R's (i.e. no audio CD's or DVD support yet).

TODOs:
------

 * Better error/checking and user feedback
 * Code documentation.
 * DVD support.
 * Add a proper setup.py and launcher script.
